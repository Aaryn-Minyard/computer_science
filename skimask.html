As Kirk mourns the loss of his old master, he hears footsteps approaching. Suddenly, he is invaded by Knight Slayer Tsorig, a powerful knight who wields a massive greatsword. Kirk, fueled by his emotions, charges at Tsorig and the two engage in an intense battle.

The fight is brutal, with each landing devastating blows on the other. Tsorig's greatsword swings down with tremendous force, but Kirk is quick and nimble, dodging and weaving through Tsorig's attacks.

In a desperate move, Tsorig attempts to strike Kirk with a powerful downward swing, but Kirk manages to dodge it and delivers a swift strike to Tsorig's side. Tsorig falls to the ground, defeated.

Breathless and injured, Kirk falls to his knees, exhausted. As he looks up, he sees a faint light emanating from The Fair Lady's corpse. He approaches her, and the light grows brighter.

Suddenly, he hears a voice calling out to him. It's The Fair Lady, speaking to him from beyond the grave. She tells him that while her physical body may be gone, her spirit lives on and will always be with him.

Overwhelmed with emotion, Kirk bows his head and offers a prayer to his fallen master. As he does, he feels a warmth spreading throughout his body, and he knows that The Fair Lady's spirit is with him, giving him strength.

The episode ends with Kirk standing up, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead, with The Fair Lady's spirit guiding him on his journey.
