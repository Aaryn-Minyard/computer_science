<p>Title: "Finger Folly"

[The episode opens with a shot of the Rosaria's Fingers office, bustling with activity. Kirk, Heysel, Creighton, and Leonhard are gathered around Rosaria's desk, engaged in a discussion.]

Rosaria: Alright, Fingers, I have a special task for you all today. We need to come up with a new slogan to promote our covenant. Something catchy and memorable.

Kirk: How about, "Join Rosaria's Fingers, where every invasion is a finger-licking good time!"

[The group looks at Kirk, unimpressed.]

Heysel: Um, Kirk, I'm not sure that's the right message we want to convey.

Creighton: Yeah, we don't want potential recruits thinking we're some kind of weird finger-licking cult.

Leonhard: [Smirking] Although, it might attract a certain type of follower.

[The group chuckles as they continue brainstorming.]

Rosaria: Alright, let's keep it professional, people. We need something that reflects our values as a covenant and appeals to a broad audience.

Heysel: How about, "Join Rosaria's Fingers, where every invasion is a helping hand."

Rosaria: I like it! It's simple, yet effective. Let's go with that.

[Just then, Silver Knight Ledo enters the office, looking slightly flustered.]

Ledo: Sorry I'm late, everyone. I got lost in the catacombs on my way here.

Creighton: [Grinning] Well, at least you found your way out. We've had interns disappear down there for weeks.

[The group laughs as Ledo takes a seat at his desk.]

Rosaria: Alright, team, let's get to work on implementing our new slogan. We have a lot of invasions to plan and fingers to recruit!

[The group cheers and gets to work, ready to tackle their next challenge with humor and camaraderie.]</p>

<p>Kirk returns to Rosaria's Fingers after his journey to the Demon Ruins feeling lost and unsure of his place in the covenant. He expects to be rejected by the Fingers for leaving without notice and disobeying Rosaria's orders.

However, when he arrives at the cathedral, he is surprised to find that the Fingers have organized a huge party in his honor. They welcome him back with open arms, thanking him for his bravery and service to the covenant.

The party is filled with laughter, food, and drink, with everyone celebrating Kirk's return. Leonhard and Creighton even apologize for their past disagreements with Kirk and acknowledge his leadership within the covenant.

Heysel, who had been worried sick about Kirk's safety, is overjoyed to see him back in one piece. She embraces him tightly and thanks him for being the best mentor and friend she could ever ask for.

Even Rosaria, who had initially been disappointed in Kirk for leaving without notice, welcomes him back with open arms. She acknowledges the bravery and skill he showed during his journey to the Demon Ruins and formally pardons him for his disobedience.

As the night goes on, Kirk realizes that he truly belongs with the Fingers. He was grateful for the love and support they have shown him, and he was touched by how much they valued him as a member of the team.

The episode ends with Kirk reflecting on the importance of loyalty, friendship, and forgiveness in his life, as he dances with Heysel and his fellow Fingers at the party.

<p>Title: Kirk's Farewell

Opening shot: Kirk stands alone in front of the entrance to the Demon Ruins, a look of determination on his face. He takes a deep breath before entering.

Cut to: Inside the Firelink Shrine, Heysel is packing a bag when Kirk enters. Heysel looks up and sees Kirk, and a look of concern crosses her face.

Heysel: "Kirk, what's going on? Why are you packing?"

Kirk: "Heysel, my old master The Fair Lady might be alive, and I need to find her. I don't know when or if I'll be coming back to Rosaria's covenant."

Heysel looks shocked and saddened by Kirk's revelation.

Heysel: "Kirk, I don't know what to say. We're going to miss you so much. You've been a valuable member of this covenant, and I know Rosaria is going to be devastated when she finds out."

Kirk: "I'll miss you all too, Heysel. You've become like family to me, and I couldn't have asked for a better group of Fingers to serve alongside."

Heysel: "Kirk, be safe out there. We don't know what dangers lie ahead, and I don't want to lose you."

Kirk nods solemnly.

Kirk: "I'll do my best, Heysel. Thank you for everything. You've been a great friend and ally."

Heysel gives Kirk a warm embrace before he grabs his bag and walks towards the exit.

Heysel: "Take care, Kirk. We'll be thinking of you."

Cut to: Kirk walking through the Demon Ruins, his torch casting eerie shadows on the walls. The sounds of demons and other creatures echo through the ruins.

Kirk (voiceover): "I don't know what lies ahead, but I have to find The Fair Lady. She's my reason for being, my purpose in this world. I can only hope that my journey will bring me back to the covenant someday."

The screen fades to black as Kirk disappears into the darkness, leaving behind the safety of Rosaria's Fingers.</p>
